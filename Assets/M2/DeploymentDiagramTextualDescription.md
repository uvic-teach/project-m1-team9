## Deployment Diagram: User Management Microservice

### Description:
This Deployment diagram provides a lower-level view of the deployment architecture for the "User Management" microservice within the Django application. It illustrates how the microservice is hosted on a GitHub deployment server, running on a virtual machine (VM), communicates with an SQLite database, and interacts with other microservices via RESTful APIs.

### Nodes:
- [GitHub Deployment Server]: The GitHub deployment server responsible for hosting the microservice.
  - **Description:** The server used for hosting and deploying the microservice.
  - **Hardware/Software:** Virtual Machine (VM)
  - **Environment:** GitHub deployment environment

### Components:
- [User Management Microservice]: The main executable component of the "User Management" microservice.
  - **Description:** The core functionality responsible for managing user-related operations.
  - **Technology/Language:** Compiled Django application
  - **Deployed On:** GitHub Deployment Server

- [Other Microservices]: Represent other microservices that interact with the "User Management" microservice via RESTful APIs.
  - **Description:** External microservices that utilize the "User Management" microservice.
  - **Technology/Language:** Various technologies
  - **Deployed On:** Their respective servers

### Artifacts:
- [SQLite Database]: The SQLite database used by the "User Management" microservice.
  - **Description:** The database for storing user-related data.
  - **Location:** Local to the GitHub Deployment Server

### Dependencies:
1. [Deployment Server to User Management Microservice]: Communication between the GitHub Deployment Server and the User Management Microservice.
   - **Description:** This represents the interaction necessary for deploying and running the microservice.
   - **Direction:** Bidirectional

2. [User Management Microservice to SQLite Database]: Communication between the User Management Microservice and the SQLite Database.
   - **Description:** Represents data retrieval and storage operations.
   - **Direction:** Bidirectional

3. [User Management Microservice to Other Microservices]: Communication between the User Management Microservice and other microservices via RESTful APIs.
   - **Description:** RESTful API calls for interactions with other microservices.
   - **Direction:** Bidirectional

### Communication Paths:
- [HTTP Requests]: Communication path for incoming HTTP requests to the User Management Microservice.
  - **Description:** Represents the interface for external clients to interact with the microservice.
  - **Protocols:** HTTP/HTTPS
  - **Source and Destination:** External clients to User Management Microservice

- [Database Queries]: Communication path for database queries between the User Management Microservice and the SQLite Database.
  - **Description:** Represents the data exchange between the microservice and the database.
  - **Protocols:** SQL queries
  - **Source and Destination:** User Management Microservice to SQLite Database

- [RESTful API Requests]: Communication path for RESTful API requests between the User Management Microservice and other microservices.
  - **Description:** Represents RESTful API calls for interactions with other microservices.
  - **Protocols:** HTTP/HTTPS
  - **Source and Destination:** User Management Microservice to Other Microservices

### Notes:
- [Note 1]: Ensure that the GitHub Deployment Server is properly configured to host the User Management Microservice.
- [Note 2]: Ensure that the User Management Microservice can establish secure connections with the SQLite Database and other microservices.
- [Note 3]: Monitor and optimize the performance of database queries and RESTful API requests for efficient data retrieval, storage, and inter-microservice communication.
